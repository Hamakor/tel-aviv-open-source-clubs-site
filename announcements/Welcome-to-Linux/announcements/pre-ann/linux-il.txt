As in previous years, we will have a Welcome-to-Linux series this year
in Tel Aviv University in the course of December, 2007:

http://welcome.linux.org.il/2007/

The purpose of the series is to introduce the Linux operating system
(and other open-source operating systems and programs) to those who
are not familiar with them.

One can find the dates of the presentations in the schedule:

http://welcome.linux.org.il/2007/timetable.html

And it can be publicised using banners and referral to the appropriate
news items:

http://welcome.linux.org.il/2007/#help_us

We also have a mailing list for coordinating and organising the series,
and those who want to help, should better join:

Please help us in publicising and advancing the series, and in case you're
new to Linux, or know someone who is, then you are welcome to attend
the presentations.
