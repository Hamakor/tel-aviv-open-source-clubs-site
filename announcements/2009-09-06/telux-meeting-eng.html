<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>
In general, I will be sharing my discovery with you: When the debugging of
modern software is required, basic GDB techniques are insufficient, but new
techniques can be created from the nearly 160 commands available in GDB.
"Modern software" refers to multi-threading, using STL and other libraries,
IPC, signals and exception mechanisms. In this lecture, I will explain
techniques for debugging large, modern software written in C++.
</p>

<p>
The presentation will be accompanied by vivid examples for all the topics.
</p>

<p>
Covered topics:

<p>
1. Preparing a program for debugging; starting the debug session
</p>

<p>
2. Controlling GDB: getting help, navigating, using breakpoints and watchpoints
</p>

<p>
3. Extending GDB through user-defined commands
</p>

<p>
4. Analyzing STL containers and algorithms
</p>

<p>
5. Dealing with multi-threading, C++ exceptions
</p>

<p>
6. Managing signals
</p>

<p>
7. Automating repetitive tasks on the almost unchanging code base
</p>

<p>
8. Remote debugging
</p>
