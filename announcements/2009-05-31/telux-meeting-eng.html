<b>Abstract</b>
</p>

<p>
Introduction to Perl 6.
</p>

<p>
A series of presentations on learning and using Perl 6 from the ground up to 
the special features.
</p>

<p>
Many would think that Perl 6 is just a new version of Perl and that it might 
only be interesting for Perl programmers. However, Perl 6 is in fact a 
compiled language running on a virtual machine that embraces many new concepts 
not found in most programming languages.
</p>

<p>
The presentations will be equally interesting for Perl, Java and C# 
programmers.
</p>

<p>
During the series of talks we will start by learning the basics of the 
language and will get to various high level concepts. For now we have
planned 2 sessions but if we need more time we'll schedule more meetings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
</p>

<p>
After the talk we will go to the caf√© at the main entrance where we can 
continue the discussion. If people bring portable computers, we can get the 
off the ground on the spot. VirtualBox images will be provided with everything 
that is needed for playing with Perl 6 set up inside. So you may opt to bring
a computer with VirtualBox installed.
